GOAL: You will not need to launch the annotation job; you are only creating 
one to demonstrate your ability to create a dataset.

- One of your biggest tasks will be to design an appropriate data 
labeling job using
https://client.appen.com/jobs

- submit an HTML file of a complete job Preview, which includes:
1. Instructions for annotation and 2. Example test questions.

- submit a Proposal document that discusses the design of the job 
and steps you'll take for quality assurance.

- You may choose to have annotators try to label an image as pneumonia 
or not (binary classification); if this is the case, you should include 
an Unknown or Other option to account for uncertainty in an annotation.

- You may also choose to have annotators describe how likely they think 
a case of pneumonia is in a given image, and you could measure this on 
a numerical scale; 0-n for their confidence that an image contains pneumonia 
symptoms or not. A scale like this automatically includes room for low-confidence 
and uncertainty.

- In your Proposal document, you will discuss your design choices and methods for 
quality assurance.
